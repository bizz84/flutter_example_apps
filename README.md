This is a directory of all my open source Flutter apps and projects. I published these as part of my tutorials at [CodeWithAndrea.com](https://codewithandrea.com).

All the entries are categorized as [beginner](#beginner), [intermediate](#intermediate), or [advanced](#advanced), based on their complexity and project size.

**I plan to expand this collection further and add more example apps in the future.**

_Note: most projects include a link to the relevant tutorial from [my website](https://codewithandrea.com) or [YouTube channel](https://nnbd.me/yt)._
